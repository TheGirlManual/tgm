From feminism, to the workplace, through female friendship and dating, to gender stereotypes and domestic violence. A podcast, blog, community, and knowledge hub of everything related to the women experience.",
  "app.containers.AboutPage.motivation": "We are Essi and Fernanda, two girls trying to understand the social dynamics around womanhood, one conversation at a time. The Girl Manual was created as part of a quest for equality by two feminists, that are frankly quite tired of being told that girls should be nice, pretty and quiet. So join us in the creation of The Girl Manual while having fun, important, and sometimes awkward conversations.",
